        Being a developer requires many skills, and there are two major factors in developing a skill: effective practice and support from senior developers. You need to maximise both of these to help you become the best developer you can be. There are three good ways to make sure that you're on a fast track to starting your developer career:
        
        Coding Bootcamps
        These are great, because they are designed to take you from little or no coding experience to job-ready in 3 months. This means lots of effective practice and tons of help from the developers running the bootcamp.
        
        The issues that you might have with bootcamps are that they are usually 3 months of full time study and they can cost from £3,000 ($4,000) to £15,000 ($20,000). That's a lot of money to spend, especially since you're not earning for those 3 months.
        
        Get a Mentor
        This is the perfect situation: you start coding and have a developer act as your mentor and tutor. They could be a friend, family member, or just a developer that wants to help you out. You won't get as much help as with a bootcamp, but having someone to turn to when you hit a roadblock is really useful. Also having someone checking in on you and making sure that you're putting in the time can help keep you on track.
        
        This sounds great, but getting a mentor can be hard. Not everyone knows someone who works as a developer, and it's a lot of extra work for the mentor. If you know a developer, they may say no to being your mentor and you need to respect that.`, auther: "Sharloc Homes", readers: 23, upload: "14 Jan 2023", tags: ["CS", "Network", "Programming"],

But responding to a call outside of the comfort outside of a doctor's office takes more than medical expertise, noted a recent article from Medscape.

        Regardless of setting or circumstance, the following qualities define the practice of medicine at its best, according to the article:
        
        Resourcefulness. Whether a medical emergency occurs on an airplane or disaster erupts on the ground, first responders need to work with what they have. That could mean using one's own belt as a tourniquet as first responders did to aid victims of terror attacks in Paris and Boston, or concocting oral rehydration solution at 30,000 feet out of sugar and salt packets and bottled water.
        Teamwork. Doctors may not always have their own practice teams with them, but a collaborative mindset is a portable asset. An anesthesiologist treating a patient on a flight from Tel Aviv to Miami, for example, described the importance of working with a second volunteer, an Israeli intensive care unit nurse, to assess and manage the patient. "We never saw each other before or after; however, we worked together as if we had been on the same team for years," he told Medscape. "I still remember her, and I thank her in my mind for her invaluable help."
        Professionalism. When responding to an emergency, physicians must overcome feelings of self-doubt, sacrifice their own comfort and convenience and even wrestle with fears of being sued--with little to no time to consider the options. Those who step up do so not just to honor the Hippocratic Oath, Medscape noted, but also to aid other professionals, such as pilots and other medical personnel, in carrying out their responsibilities. Indeed, doctors who responded to the November 13 terror attacks in Paris wrote in The Lancet: "If I had to summarise the 'winning formula' in the recent tragic hours that we lived, in an orthopaedic centre of APHP [Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris], I would say that spontaneity and professionalism were the key ingredients."`, auther: "Feluda Mittir", readers: 64, upload: "1 Jan 2023", tags: ["Medical", "Doctor", "Nurse"],

When looking around, it's tempting to think, “Hey, anyone can do this!” But it's important to remember that there's a difference between merely starting a business on paper and setting yourself up for success. Done correctly, it takes careful planning, investment, and motivation. Going in blind and starting a business without knowing what you're getting into can lead to costly failure.

        In this article, we'll attempt to take as much of the guesswork out of the process as possible by showing you how to start a business in 13 general steps. Some of these steps will be slightly different based on the region you live in. For example, the “legal stuff” in this article specifically focuses on the US.
        
        That said, no matter where you reside we recommend checking with a local lawyer and your local government to determine any legal requirements for starting a business in your area. Nothing in this article should be considered legal advice.
        
        With that caveat out of the way, let's talk about what you need to do to not only start your business but set yourself up for success!
        
        1. Start with You
        Don't just jump in. Make sure you have what it takes to run your own business. Don't limit yourself, but evaluate yourself to know who you're dealing with. Know your strengths, weaknesses, likes, dislikes, tastes, and interests. Know your skills, passions, the lifestyle you're after, how much you can spend, how much you can afford to risk, and the types of work you want to do.
        
        Not everyone can be their own boss. It takes motivation and discipline to see the project through and it's difficult to stick with something you don't like. It's okay if you don't know much about business itself at first. Take courses if you need to. The important thing is that you're completely invested in (and a good fit for) the work required for the business you choose to create.
        
        2. The Business Idea
        It pays to spend some time on the business idea. Here are a few things to ponder:
        
        Maybe you have a better solution to an annoying problem. What problems can you solve?
        
        Look at what's coming soon in various industries such as technology, health, entertainment, etc. Ask how it will change life or business in general and what you can do to position yourself (and your business) to capitalize on that change.
        
        How can you apply your skills to a different industry? For example, do you have a unique skill set or way of thinking learned in one industry that has yet to be applied to another? Perhaps there's opportunity there?
        
        Can you provide something better or cheaper than it's currently being provided? Can you provide something to a location that doesn't have access to it?
        
        You can also search the web for business ideas and take note of those that sound like a good fit for you.
        
        One method is to ask yourself a few simple questions that will help you narrow down your options:
        
        What are your strengths?
        Of those strengths, what is in demand?
        Of what is in demand, what can you afford to provide?
        Once you have a few ideas, run them by someone you trust that has a strong sense of business. Ask for advice from other entrepreneurs that you trust.
        
        3. Perform Market Research
        Once you have your business idea, research it to make sure that it's in demand, that there's room in the market for you, and that you can afford to provide it. Perform a SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats).
        
        Research your competitors and the market demand in the area you'll provide the business. This might require you to interview businesses to see if they need your product or service.
        
        You have to figure out your unique advantage-often referred to as a unique selling proposition. Your business will fail if you're number 75 trillion on Google that's offering the same service. How are you different? What can you do that they're not doing?
        
        It's important to do your own research. Someone else's research might not be complete or it could be out of date. They may have focused on a different point than you need to. Also, don't just search online. Go to the source. The more time you invest up front the fewer problems you'll run into later.
        
        4. Write a Business Plan
        A business plan is a written description of your business. It works like a roadmap and should be updated over time. It helps give you the information you need to develop the business and get funding (or what it will take to bootstrap, if that's the path you choose). It also provides projections to help you decide how viable your idea is.
        
        There are several ways to create a business plan. The Small Business Administration recommends creating a detailed description of each point in this structure”`, readers: 35, upload: "29 Jan 2023", tags: ["Business", "Management"],
